tabel
// %  Difference between Cellpadding and Cellspacing
// %  Cellpadding:Cellpadding specifies the space between the border of a table cell and its contents (i.e)
// %   it defines the whitespace between the cell edge and the content of the cell.(ander)

// %  Syntax:
// %  <table cellpadding="value" >.....</table>
// %  where, value determines the padding 
// %  (space between the border of a table and its content)
// %  Cellspacing:Cellspacing specifies the space between cells (i.e) it defines the whitespace between the edges of the adjacent cells.(bahir)

// %  Syntax:
// %  <table cellspacing="value" >.....</table>
// %  where, value determines the padding 
// %  (space between adjacent cells) 
 




// %        important to note that :- 
// %          width="50" height="100"  yeh thead ko affect nhi kary ga means no chang
        
// %         row and colspan difference 
// %           ROWSPAN is used to combine the cells vertically. It merges the number of cells vertically and 
// %           displays them as a single cell. COLSPAN is used to combine the cells horizontally. 
// %          It specifies the number of columns that the cells span across and shows them as a single cell. 



// %                                  form
// % An HTML form is a section of a document containing normal content, markup, special elements called controls
// % (checkboxes, radio buttons, menus, etc.), and labels on those controls.

 <!-- Here are some HTML practice questions involving tables and forms to help you strengthen your skills:

// % Table Practice Questions:
// % Create a Simple Table:

// % Create a table with 3 rows and 4 columns.
// % The first row should contain headers for "Name," "Age," "Email," and "Country."
// % Fill the table with any data of your choice.
// % Table with Merged Cells:

// % Create a table that includes a header row spanning two columns.
// % Add a footer row that spans across all columns.
// % Styled Table:

// % Create a table to display product details like "Product Name," "Price," and "Quantity."
// % Style the table using CSS (borders, background color for the header, alternating row colors).
// % Complex Table:

// % Create a table to display class schedule information with "Day," "Subject," "Start Time," and "End Time."
// % Merge cells for subjects that span across multiple days.
// % Responsive Table:

// % Design a table that displays book information ("Title," "Author," "Price").
// % Use CSS to make the table responsive on smaller screens.
// % Form Practice Questions:
